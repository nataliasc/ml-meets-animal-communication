# Information about our dataset
## Recordings made with autonomous recording units (ARUs)
* Location: Tai National Park, Cote d’Ivoire
* Recorded between **November 2011 and May 2012** using 20 ARUs (Songmeter SM2, Wildlife Acoustics Inc., Concord, MA, USA)
* Recorded from **6 am to 6 pm** over a period of seven consecutive months
* Total: **12 889 h** of recordings
* Species present in the recordings: **chimpanzees _Pan troglodytes ssp. verus_**, Diana monkey _Cercopithecus diana_, King colobus _Colobus polykomos_ and Western red colobus _Procolobus badius_
* Approximately ?? individual chimpanzees are present in these recordings (can we make a rough guess here?) --> the population of the community if you consider it as a somewhat random sampling in the forest?
* Labels: 65 recording either manually checked or analyzed by automated detectors before -- the ground truth needs to be confirmed before using as there are inter-labeler disagreement

## High-quality directional microphone recordings
* Location: Tai National Park, Cote d’Ivoire
* Recorded between more or less the same time period as ARU (?)
* Dawn-to-Dusk focal follow
* Number of individual chimpanzees in these recordings: **8 males, 6 females, 6 young chimpanzees**
* Labels: names of individuals, types of calls (7 distinct types)     
The information contained in the filenames:    
    * PH = pant hoot
    * SM = scream
    * TB = buttress drumming (non-vocal sound)

Shorthand for individuals' names:    
* Males: WOO (woodstock), KUB (Kuba), UTA (utan), JAC (Jacobo), ROM (Romario), IBR (Ibrahim), SHO (Shogun), CAR (Caramel) (note: the last three were very young at the time of the study)
