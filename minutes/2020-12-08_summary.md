# Summary of the meeting with Ulf and Axel 8th Dec (12:15pm-1:58pm) \@BBB

**Attendees**: Axel, Bhaskar, Felix, Franca, Hunaid, Johannes, Krupal, Natalia, Rachael, Saurabh, Shantanu, Ulf, Yeji

## WP1
1. Discussed the overall approach from the supervised learning point of view.
2. Ulf asked about the format of data we will be utilizing for our analysis, to which we suggested a 2-d spectogram.
3. For supervised automatic voice detection the low sample size is an issue and Ulf suggested a common workaround among all three WP's to get unsupervised feature extraction.
4. For classification problem, there was a suggestion to redefine the classes through unsupervised clustering in order to redefine the classes.



## WP2
...  

## WP3 Clustering and subunit identification
1. For the clustering part: If using k-means: Justification for selecting k=13? Different number of call types identified in the literature (e.g., Slocombe \& Zuberbühler 2011) than the number of labels in our dataset.
2. For the subunit identification: Looking at analytical units as opposed to production or perception units (distinction made by Kershenbaum et al. 2016), as we only have access to observational data recordings. Possibly adapt techniques used for analysing sequences in birdsong and humpback whale songs—although their songs may be structurally more elaborate(?) than chimpanzee 'phrases.' Possibly use Hidden Markov Models or self-organizing maps.  
If subunits are identified, they can later be used for correlating sequences with behavioural and contextual data (if we get access to those).

For all work packages: what are the acoustic features that will be used in the analysis?
