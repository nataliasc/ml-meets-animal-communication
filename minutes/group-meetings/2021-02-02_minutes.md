Meeting on WP updates with Ulf
Date: 2021-02-02 (Tue) Time: 12:15 @StudIP
Participants: Ulf, Johannes and Krupal
Moderator/who holds the meeting: Krupal
Minutes taken by: Krupal

What's discussed:
As we were waiting if someone joins a bit late, Johannes clarified his doubts about Interdisciplinary Vs. Study project difference and expectations.

Echo State Network : Johannes worked on multidimentional input, specifically 3 dimensions for spectrograms as we are converting audio files to spectrograms first. The discussion went on for what the 3rd dimension is and colour was one of the guess but we can still confirm it.
Can we work with time and frequency parameters (2 dimensions) has also came up with one direction to check for. Also, how size of the reservior plays a role can also be a potential parameter to check.

To-dos/Next Steps & who will do what by what time:
Unsupervised group shall continue their work.
Johannes shall check what are the common ways to feed Echo State Network, specially for audio files.
All members : In case you know someone who worked on ESN for audio files and they can lead us to some useful material, that will be of great help.

Next meeting : 2021-02-16 (Tue) Time: 12:15 @StudIP
