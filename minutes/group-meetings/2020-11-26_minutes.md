**_Transfer to the chimpanzee dataset:_**
- Look into identifying the features that the trained networks find important.
- A follow-up exercise: apply the techniques mentioned in the paper on the trained killer whale detector (binary classification: noise vs. killer whale).

We will meet with the supervisors to discuss and finalise the WPs during the week 51 (Dec 7–Dec 11).

Also: there is an option to meet and further discuss the topic of interpretable AI during the Christmas break.
