**A scrum-inspired approach for agile project management (by Jannik)**
 1. The basic theory behind scrum --> check out [the 2020 scrum guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2020/2020-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf)
 2. Take-away for our SP:
as a group decide what's important about managing the group project
 3. questions/points during discussion:
3.1. *stand-up meeting*:
a. time limit shall be enforced to keep people from ramble on while sharing (Hunaid)
b. for a 5min stand-up, 3 questions shall be answered:
--> what did you do yesterday
--> what were the challenges and how did you overcome them
--> what will you do next/today
3.2. as daily meetings/standup meeting (in scrum) are not realistic for SP, find an alternative to implement regular self-reflection?
4. progress is measured by whether reaching pre-defined milestone --> the group & subgroups work towards those
5. A tip for working with supervisors: do not take criticism personally; it is about acknowledging when making mistakes and improving
6. 6.1. split into subgroups/WPs based on personal interests
6.2. product owner: incorporating also the interest and vision of other team members to deliver a shared product
7. during implementation: using asana/similar task boards or kanban style planning to stay focused and organized.
i.e. product backlog
--> Jannik's recommendation: keep it from growing too organically. Otherwise, it ends up being very hard to comprehend and to navigate
8. Good practice from Jannik's SP: set predetermined timeframes where a predefined set of problems need to be solved, as opposed to solving never ending chores

**Upcoming events**
1. hangout on Sat: 1500, to chat about ideas and to get to know each other personally
2. **Next Tue (8th Dec) 1215**: meeting with Ulf (potentially Axel)
3. **Next Wed (9th Dec) 1330** for the chimp acoustic communication 101, plus discussion about the linguistic/communication related-WPs you would like to develop
4. **Next Thur (10th Dec) 1830**: meeting with Sophia and her team - SP sharing
