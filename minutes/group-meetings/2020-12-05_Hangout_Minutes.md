## Minutes of hangout - 5th Dec (3pm-6pm) @Dodesheide

**Attendees**: Bhaskar, Hunaid, Johannes, Krupal, Sarah, Saurabh, Shantanu, Rachael  (Minutes taken by Racheal)

### Focuses of discussion: 
1. interest of individuals --> form subgroups
2. personal expectations of the SP
3.  preliminary workflow that needs to be completed together with the rest of the group

#### Part 1: Individual interest & personal expectations of the SP
##### Shantanu:
*Interest*: classification/supervised learning - high accuracy & best model for a give task
*Personal expectation*: learn to apply ML/DL theories/knowledge to solve real world problems (applied work)

##### Saurabh:
*Background*: 
- behavioral studies (human) & economics (e.g. worked on randomized control trials)
- No ML/DL exposures yet, started Python 6 months ago
- interested in dynamic systems as well

*Interest*: comparing automatically identified acoustic patterns against behavioral and contextual data; for example, using sub-call types and their combinations to investigate call-response
(emotions are multi-layers - will not be approached in the current SP)
--> since the automatically identified call sequences are not in place and the behavioral data is currently not accessible, willing to work on previous WPs, such as identification of sub-call types, how calls are combined into different call sequences
 
*Personal expectation / personal deadlines*: 
- gain exposure and deeper understanding of ML/DL through hands-on learning and working in the current SP
- intended to do PhD in 2022 in human behavioral science - decision making on ambiguity, therefore would like to obtain a strong recommendation letter through/after the SP
--> other team members recommend to approach Michael Franke for his other research interests (cognitive modeling)

##### Rachael:
*Interest*: 
- completing automated detection (ResNet + transfer learning) by March the latest so that more calls could be extracted from the continuous recording for other WPs
- unsupervised methods for sub-units identification (similar to zero resource human languages)
- representation learning

##### Sarah (Bachelor thesis on Minke Whale acoustic detection):
*Interest/Preliminary Work Plan*: 
- transfer learning (killer whale to Minke) e.g. retrain the last layer
-  Tensorflow version of detector (original killer whale detector is in Pytorch) for mobile device so that it could be deployed in the field to give more spontaneous feedback of recording situation (e.g. if the current location is a hotspot for recording or it should be changed)
- JupyterNote book version for easier code modification to train on new datasets

##### Hunaid:
*Interest/Primary Direction*:
unsupervised feature learning - machine learn by itself to identify where the discriminant information lies (i.e. dim reduction, feature extraction & down sampling)
--> autoencoder: utilize bottle neck features
*Personal expectation / personal deadlines*:  publication (from the SP work) as a priority (because of intended PhD in 2022 in neuroscience or applying for resident program of top tech companies)
--> personal evaluation criteria of the success of the current SP

##### Johannes  (IDC):
*Interest/Focus*: apply Echo State Network to chimp detection

##### Bhaskar (IDC):
*Interest/Focus*:
unsupervised learning with Hunaid

*Others*:
-available till April, would need grade of IDC in June/July
- **question**: how far one could progress on the selected WP till the end of March/April? If one could not complete the chosen WP by the end of March/April, would grade be affected?

##### Krupal:
*Interest*:
originally in detection, now interested in the white box approach presented by Hunaid

#### Part 2: preliminary workflow (needs to be completed together with the rest of the group)
If the end goal is to be able to automatically identify reappearing acoustic sequences and to eventually compare against behavioral and contextual data, the group used the hangout session to identify the tasks that needs to be accomplished beforehand.

Besides, as data pre-processing often takes a lot more time than expected, the group also reached agreement on what workflows one could already start to build using the existing labeled data, before a lot more outputs from previous steps are ready (i.e. before more data are generated by the previous task).

Two branches of workflow are therefore drafted for WPs- detection, classification & clustering. And the PICs （Person-In-Charge) of the respective branches have been confirmed:
1. classical approach (verified in other similar studies): ResNet & transfer learning to detectin and classify calls
**(PIC: Shantanu)**
2. explorative and experimental approach: unsupervised feature learning (i.e. autoencoder)
**(PIC: Hunaid)**

(Diagram and other details about the drafted tasks will be uploaded later to slack.)

##### other ideas on the table:
1. use LSTM to learn single chimp calls and decode what LSTM learns
2. Transformer: state-of-the-art, applied to images (shall approach Philip for more info)


#### Part 3: issues await to be discussed or solved
1. clear expectation / criteria of success / failure of SP (Saurabh)
2. gap in the SP: domain knowledge of chimp acoustic communication and behavioral context of how different calls / variations of calls are used --> how to proceed
