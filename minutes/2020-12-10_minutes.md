## Minutes of SP 5th Journal Club - 10rd Dec (6:30pm-8:15pm) @StudIP

**Attendees**: Bhaskar, Felix, Franca, Hunaid, Johannes, Josefine, Katharina, Krupal, Maren, Natalia, Rachael, Saurabh, Shantanu, Sophia, (Yeji could not make it as she is 8h ahead of us)
**Format**: online (StudIP)

### Part 1: Completed SP sharing

**structured group work:**
- assign manager-roles to split responsibilities --> managers are responsible for certain tasks/resources (e.g. managing Github/GRID, meeting moderation, etc.)
- create a rough work roadmap for the overall project, but leave the detailed planning to the individual subgroups
- set a deadline for tasks as guidance and note reasons if a deadline could not be met
- seek for other experts (apart from Ulf and Axel) who can help to answer specific questions

**meeting moderation:**
- for each meeting assign a moderator and a minute writer
- for meetings with Ulf and Axel try to prepare a protocol containing the current problem and the approaches to solve the problem --> give them an adequate overview and ask rather specific questions

**organisational work:**
- stick to known approaches for data sharing/managing (e.g. Google docs/Github)
- offer meetings to share knowledge, so that everyone is able to use these resources
- Github: work with pull requests and let another member check the changes before merging

### Part 2: Continue WPs & Workflow discussion
- Felix’ presentation on preprocessing experiments is postponed until next Thursday

### Part 3: On-going ‘construction’ updates
- Natalia found out that most of the directional recordings are not labeled. --> We have to either wait for unsupervised feature learning to give a good foundation for clustering, which could be used for batch labelling, or start to learn how to classify different call types acoustically and by inspecting spectrogram. The latter would yield labels of high quality data for cluster experiments and gain expertise within the group on chimp calls that is valuable for respective tasks.
- Lara will be contacted to get access to her high quality recordings.
- Franca is scheduling a meeting with Ulf and his computer vision group to dive deeper into transfer learning.

### Part 4: Meeting plan for next week
- Next Tue (15th Dec) 12:15: meeting with Ulf and Axel
- Next Thur (17th Dec) 18:30: Felix’ presentation on preprocessing experiments for WP2
- Next Fri (18th Dec) 9:00: for transfer learning exchange: meeting with Ulf and members of the computer vision group
