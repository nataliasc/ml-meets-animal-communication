# Touch base meeting of WP3
Time: 2020-12-12 (Sat) 14:02-14:35     
**Format:** Zoom    

**Attendees**: Yeji, Natalia


1. rather than only waiting for the features that will be learned from WP2, we decided to try some clustering with part of existing labeled data based on the paper 'Vervets revisited: A quantitative analysis of alarm call structure and context specificity' by Price et al. (2015) and see what happens.
2. to think about what variables we should use for the task.    
We could adapt the same acoustic variables as Price et al. (2015) use, namely:
    * call duration
    * number of call elements within a call
    * inter-element interval (ms)

    * element duration (ms)
    * peak frequency (Hz)
    * PF jump (Hz)
    * first quartile (Hz)
    * second quartile (Hz)
    * FP1 mean (Hz)
    * FP1A mean (rel. amplitude)
    * Frequency range (Hz)
    * Wiener Entropy
It might make sense to analyse male and female data separately if there are substantial differences between their calls.
